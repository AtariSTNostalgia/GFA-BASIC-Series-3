# GFA-BASIC-Series-3
Here you can find all example code I used in the GFA Basic series 3 of videos on my Atari ST Nostalgia YouTube channel.
I will be adding the code after each video had been published.

# Usage
The code is provided as-is for everyone to play around with as they please.
The code will be posted in .LST format, so you can merge whatever parts you want to use into your existing code.
The code was mainly written for experimenting, learning, and show-and-tell.
My goal is to make others enthousiastic about retro-coding using this greatest BASIC interpreter ever made.

# GFA BASIC version
All code was written in GFA BASIC version 3.5 for the Atari ST.
Merging the listings into newer versions should not be a problem most of the time, but some alterations to the code may be required.
Please do not use older versions of GFA BASIC since some of the commands will not work.

# Help and getting started
For explanation of the code please watch the video series on my YouTube channel:
